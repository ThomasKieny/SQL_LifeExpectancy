# SQL_LifeExpectancy
This project enabled me to show my SQL skills in terms of data cleaning with a dataset found online.

The CSV file named WorldLifeExpectancy.csv is the initial dataset found online. Started from here and cleaned it to have a dataset ready for EDA. 
The WorldLifeExpectancy_Complement.csv is a complement to the initial dataset where values were missing. It was found online : https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN

After all these cleaning steps, we will focus on the EDA phase.
